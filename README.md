## üß† Personalization System

The Micro-Commute Optimizer includes a sophisticated personalization system that learns from your usage patterns and adapts route planning to your preferences.

### **Telemetry Collection**

The system automatically collects anonymous usage data to learn your preferences:

- **Plan Selections**: Records when you choose specific routes
- **Mode Overrides**: Tracks when you change transportation modes
- **Distance Patterns**: Learns preferences by trip distance
- **Privacy-First**: All data stored locally in your browser

### **Preference Learning**

The personalization model uses advanced techniques to learn your preferences:

- **Laplace Smoothing**: Prevents overfitting with small datasets
- **Distance Bucketing**: Separates preferences by trip distance (<1km, 1-2km, 2-5km, 5km+)
- **Mode Weighting**: Applies learned preferences to route scoring
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Preferences affect planning immediately

### **User Controls**

You have full control over personalization:

- **Short Walk Toggle**: Prefer walking for trips under 2km
- **Telemetry Dashboard**: View collected data and statistics
- **Data Management**: Clear personalization data anytime
- **Privacy Settings**: All data stays in your browser

### **How It Works**

1. **Data Collection**: System records your route choices and mode preferences
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Identifies preferences by distance and context
3. **Weight Calculation**: Computes personalized mode weights using Laplace smoothing
4. **Route Bias**: Applies learned preferences to route planning algorithm
5. **Continuous Learning**: System improves with each interaction

### **Example Personalization**

```typescript
// After using the app for a week, the system learns:
// - You prefer walking for trips < 1km (weight: 1.2)
// - You prefer transit for trips 2-5km (weight: 1.15)
// - You avoid driving for short trips (weight: 0.85)

// These weights automatically bias route planning:
const weights = computeModeWeights(800) // 800m trip
// Returns: { walk: 1.2, transit: 0.9, drive: 0.85 }
```

### **Privacy & Security**

- **Local Storage Only**: No data leaves your browser
- **No Tracking**: No external analytics or tracking
- **User Control**: You can clear data anytime
- **Transparent**: View all collected data in the dashboard
